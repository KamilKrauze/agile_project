Millet & Black Lentil Stuffed Delicata Squash

Ingredinents

4 average size delicata squash about 10-12 ounces each, split in half lengthwise and seeds removed
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 small white or yellow onion chopped
2 stalks celery chopped
2 carrots peeled and chopped
2 cloves garlic minced
3/4 cup millet
1/2 cup black lentils
3/4 teaspoon sea salt
3 cups low sodium vegetable broth
Black pepper to taste
FOR THE GRAVY (MAKES 1 1/2 CUPS)
1/4 cup unbleached all-purpose flour (substitute chickpea flour for a gluten free version)
3 tablespoons nutritional yeast flakes
1 1/2 cups low-sodium vegetable broth
2 tablespoons tamari
2 teaspoons olive oil
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme crushed
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
Black pepper to taste

Cooking instructions
Preheat your oven to 400F and line two baking sheets with parchment or foil. Spray or brush both sides of the squash with oil. Place the squash, cut side down, on the baking sheets. Roast for 25-35 minutes, or until the squash are fork tender and browning.
While the squash halves roast, heat the oil in a medium sized pot. Add the onion, celery, and carrots. Cook, stirring every now and then, for 5-7 minutes, or until the onion is soft and clear. Add the garlic and millet. Toast the millet for about 2 minutes, or until it smells a bit nutty. Add the salt and broth. Bring the millet to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20-25 minutes, or until the lentils are tender (but a little al dente) and the millet has absorbed all of the liquid. Remove the millet from heat and allow it to steam while you make the gravy.
To prepare the gravy, heat the flour and nutritional yeast in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir them frequently, and continue cooking until they smell toasted and the flour is just golden (about 5 minutes). Remove them from heat and whisk in the vegetable broth, tamari, olive oil, thyme, and garlic powder. Return the mixture to low heat and cook, whisking constantly, until the gravy is thick and bubbly. Season to taste with black pepper and remove from heat.
When the squash halves are ready, flip them over. Taste the millet and black lentil stuffing and adjust salt and pepper as needed. Stuff each squash half with the stuffing, then top with the gravy (or another sauce or dressing). Serve.
Notes:
Millet and black lentil stuffing can be prepared a day in advance, and the squashes can be roasted a day in advance. Gravy can be prepared up to 2 days in advance, or frozen for up to 3 weeks.

Pearl barley and tomato risotto recipe
Ingredients
100g sundried tomatoes (drained weight), finely chopped, plus 1 tbsp oil from the jar
1 onion, finely chopped

https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/perfect_popcorn/
Popcorn
Ingredients
3 Tbsp Coconut Oil
1/3 Cup of high quality popcorn kernels
1 Tbsp of butter
Salt to taste
Cooking instructions

STEP 1
Heat the oil in a 3-quart saucepan on medium high heat. If you are using coconut oil, allow all of the solid oil to melt.
STEP 2
Put 3 or 4 popcorn kernels into the oil and cover the pan.
STEP 3
When the kernels pop, add the rest of the 1/3 cup of popcorn kernels in an even layer. Cover, remove from heat and count 30 seconds. (Count out loud; it's fun to do with kids.) This method first heats the oil to the right temperature, then waiting 30 seconds brings all of the other kernels to a near-popping temperature so that when they are put back on the heat, they all pop at about the same time.
STEP 4
Return the pan to the heat. The popcorn should begin popping soon, and all at once. Once the popping starts in earnest, gently shake the pan by moving it back and forth over the burner. Try to keep the lid slightly ajar to let the steam from the popcorn release (the popcorn will be drier and crisper). Once the popping slows to several seconds between pops, remove the pan from the heat, remove the lid, and dump the popcorn immediately into a wide bowl. With this technique, nearly all of the kernels pop, and nothing burns.
STEP 5
If you are adding butter, you can easily melt it by placing the butter in the now empty, but hot pan. Note that if you let the butter get just a little bit brown, it will add an even more intense, buttery flavor to the butter and to your popcorn. (Here's more info on how to brown butter.) Just drizzle the melted butter over the popcorn and toss to distribute.

Add salt to taste

Thai quinoa salad
Ingredients
Salad
1/2 cup uncooked white quinoa
2 cups kale
1 cup edamame 
2 cups coleslaw mix (or shredded cabbage)
1 red pepper coarsely chopped
1 cup matchstick (or shredded) carrots
1 cup coarsely chopped mango 
1/2 cup coarsely chopped cilantro (~1/2 bunch)
1/4 cup thinly sliced green onions (~3-4 onions)
1/2 cup cashews coarsely chopped roasted and lightly salted
Dressing
1/4 cup creamy peanut butter
3 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons hot water
1 clove garlic coarsely chopped
1 and 1/2 tablespoons EACH: rice vinegar and low sodium soy sauce
Fine sea salt and freshly cracked pepper

Cooking instructions
QUINOA: Prepare the quinoa by rinsing it under cold water in a fine mesh sieve to remove the bitter saponin coating. Combine the quinoa and 1 cup water in a small pot over high heat. Bring to a boil, add in 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt (or to taste), reduce the heat to low, and cover the pot. Simmer for 10-15 minutes or until the liquid is absorbed. Remove from heat, keep the quinoa covered, and let stand for 10-15 minutes. Fluff with a fork and place in the fridge or freezer to cool to room temperature.
EDAMAME: Meanwhile, bring a pot with 6 cups of water to a boil, then add in 1 tablespoon fine sea salt, and the 1 cup of frozen and shelled edamame. Cook for 2-3 minutes or until edamame is tender. Drain thoroughly.
KALE: Remove the thick stems and then very thinly slice (ribbon) the kale. The smaller the shreds of kale, the better! Once it's all chopped, put it in a colander (or the base of a salad spinner) and give it a quick rinse. Rub and massage the kale for about a minute and then give it another quick rinse. Allow the kale to dry completely before using in the salad or spin in the salad spinner to dry it quickly.
VEGGIE/FRUIT PREP: Thinly slice the cabbage or measure out 2 cups of coleslaw mix. Coarsely chop the red pepper, mango, cilantro (and then loosely measure to get 1/2 cup) and the cashews. Thinly slice the green onions.
DRESSING: Place 1/4 cup creamy peanut butter, 3 tablespoons honey, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 2 tablespoons hot water, coarsely chopped garlic clove, 1 and 1/2 tablespoons rice vinegar, 1 and 1/2 tablespoons low sodium soy sauce, 1/8 teaspoon pepper, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a small blender jar. Process until smooth and refrigerate while preparing everything else.
SALAD ASSEMBLY: Combine the cooked and completely cooled quinoa, shredded kale, coleslaw/cabbage, red pepper, carrots, mango, cilantro, green onions, and cashews in a large bowl. Drizzle with dressing (to desired preference; we use all the dressing, but you may prefer less; see instruction #7). Toss to combine and enjoy!
STORAGE: This salad doesn't sit well with the dressing, so only dress what will be enjoyed the same day. Store any leftover salad and dressing separately.

Vegan Sushi
Ingredients
300g sushi rice
2 tbsp rice or white wine vinegar
1 tsp caster sugar
1 large avocado
juice ½ lemon
cucumber strips
2 red peppers
4 sheets nori seaweed
1 bunch chives
sweet soy sauce (kecap manis), to serve


Cooking instructions
STEP 1
Put the rice in a small pan with 600ml water. Bring to the boil and cook for 10 mins until the water is absorbed and the rice is tender. Stir through the vinegar and sugar, cover and cool.

STEP 2
Skin, stone and slice the avocado. Put in a bowl and squeeze over the lemon juice, turning the avocado to ensure the pieces are covered.

STEP 3
Divide the rice between the nori sheets and spread it out evenly, leaving a 1cm border at the top and bottom. Lay your favourite fillings over the rice, followed by the chives and finally position the avocado across the centre.

STEP 4
Fold the bottom edge of the seaweed over the filling, then roll it up firmly. Dampen the top border with a little water to help it seal the roll. Repeat to make 4 rolls. At this stage, the rolls can be wrapped individually in cling film and chilled until ready to serve.

STEP 5
Using a serrated knife, cut each roll into 8 rounds. Serve with sweet soy sauce for dipping.

Vegetarian lasagne

Ingredients
2 yellow or red peppers, seeds removed, cut into roughly 2cm/¾in chunks
1 courgette, about 300g/10½oz, quartered lengthways and cut into roughly 2cm/¾in chunks
1 large sweet potato, peeled and cut into roughly 2cm/¾in chunks
3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1 large onion, finely chopped
½ tsp dried chilli flakes
2 garlic cloves, crushed
2 x 400g tins chopped tomatoes
2 tsp Italian seasoning or dried oregano
1 vegetable stock cube
200ml/7fl oz cold water
100g/3½oz young spinach leaves (optional)
9 –10 dried lasagne sheets
salt and freshly ground black pepper
For the cheese sauce
75g/2½oz plain flour
75g/2½oz butter, cubed
750ml/1¼ pint milk, semi-skimmed or full-fat
125g/4½oz mature cheddar, coarsely grated
75g/2½oz grated mozzarella, or extra cheddar




Cooking instructions
Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. Put the peppers, courgette and sweet potato into a large baking tray. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons of the oil, season with salt and pepper and toss together.

Roast for 30 minutes, or until softened and lightly browned.

While the vegetables are roasting, heat the remaining oil in a large saucepan and gently fry the onion for 5 minutes, stirring regularly.

Add the chilli and garlic and cook for a few seconds more. Stir in the tomatoes, Italian seasoning (or dried oregano) and crumbled stock cube. Pour over the water and bring to a gentle simmer. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring regularly. Set aside.

For the cheese sauce, put the flour, butter and milk in a large saucepan and place over a medium heat. Whisk constantly with a large metal whisk until the sauce is thickened and smooth. (Use a silicone covered whisk if cooking in a non-stick pan.) Stir in roughly two-thirds of the cheeses and season to taste.

Take the vegetables out of the oven and add to the pan with the tomato sauce. Stir in the spinach and cook together for 3 minutes. Season with salt and lots of ground black pepper.

Spoon a third of the vegetable mixture over the base of a 2½ –3 litre/4½–5¼ pint ovenproof lasagne dish and cover with a single layer of lasagne. Top with another third of the vegetable mixture (don’t worry if it doesn’t cover evenly) and a second layer of lasagne.

Pour over just under half of the cheese sauce and very gently top with the remaining vegetable mixture. Finish with a final layer of lasagne and the rest of the cheese sauce. Sprinkle the reserved cheese over the top.

Bake for 35–40 minutes, or until the pasta has softened and the topping is golden brown and bubbling. Stand for 5 minutes before cutting to allow the filling to settle.

Italian veggie balls

Ingredients
For the meatballs
225g/8oz dried brown lentils
2 brown onions, finely chopped
1 tbsp olive oil, plus a tsp extra for greasing
4 garlic cloves, crushed
100g/3½oz baby spinach
4 tbsp readymade basil pesto
1 lemon, zest only
50g/1¾oz pine nuts, toasted (alternatively use finely chopped almonds or, for a nut-free alternative, the same quantity of whole oats)
1 large free-range egg
50g/1¾oz fresh breadcrumbs (wholemeal or white)
300g/10½oz dried spaghetti (or linguine, tagliatelle etc.)
For the tomato sauce
2 x 400g tins chopped tomatoes
2 tbsp tomato purée
1 tsp red wine vinegar
1 tbsp granulated or caster sugar
few basil leaves, plus extra to serve
salt and freshly ground black pepper


Cooking instructions
Heat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. Cook the lentils in a large pan of boiling water for 20–25 minutes until soft. Drain really well, then leave sitting in the sieve to finish drying and draining for 5 minutes. Put the kettle on.

Meanwhile fry the chopped onions in the oil until soft, but not brown, for about 10 minutes. Stir in the garlic, then cook together for 2 minutes more. Scrape half of the onion mixture out of the pan and into a food processor – leave the rest in the pan for the sauce. Put the spinach in a colander and pour over the boiling water from the kettle to wilt the spinach. When cool enough to touch, squeeze as much liquid out of the spinach as you can.

Tip the cooked lentils into the food processor with the onions, then add the spinach, pesto and lemon zest. Whizz until the mixture is combined, but don’t blend to a complete mush. Pulse in the pine nuts (or almonds or oats). Scrape into a mixing bowl and combine with the egg and breadcrumbs. Season with salt and pepper and mix thoroughly. Roll into 20 balls, place on a greased baking tray and bake for 15–20 minutes, or until golden-brown and firm.

Meanwhile make the sauce. Add the tinned tomatoes, tomato purée, vinegar and sugar to the onion pan along with 500ml/18fl oz water. Stir in some basil leaves and a little salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Bring to a simmer and bubble for 15–18 minutes over a medium heat. Meanwhile cook the pasta according to the packet instructions.

When the meat-free balls are browned and cooked through, stir them in the sauce. Scatter with more basil leaves and serve with the spaghetti.

Mushroom Wellington
Ingredients
7 large flat or portobello mushrooms
2–3 tbsp olive oil
2 brown onions, finely chopped
160g/5¾oz dried apricots
400g tin green lentils, drained and rinsed
200g/7oz mixed nuts (such as walnuts, pecans and almonds)
4 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves picked
3 sprigs fresh rosemary, leaves picked
2 x 320g packs ready-rolled vegan puff pastry
4 garlic cloves, finely chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper


Cooking instructions
Preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7. Line a baking tray with baking paper.

Put the mushrooms in a large roasting tin, season with a pinch of salt and pepper and drizzle with olive oil. Bake for 15 minutes.

Heat a frying pan over a medium heat, add a drizzle of olive oil and as soon as it is hot, add the onions and fry for 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, put the dried apricots in a food processor, add 100ml/3½fl oz water and blend to a smooth paste. Transfer to a large mixing bowl. Put the lentils, nuts, thyme and rosemary in the food processor and process until mostly broken down. Tip the mixture into the bowl with the apricots, then add the fried onion and a pinch of salt and pepper. Stir until fully combined and the stuffing holds together.

Unroll the first sheet of pastry onto the lined baking tray and spread a third of the stuffing mixture lengthways down the middle in a strip about 5cm/2in wide, leaving 5cm/2in clear at both ends. Lay four of the mushrooms, gills facing up, on top of the stuffing and sprinkle over the garlic. Place the remaining three mushrooms on top, gills facing down.

Spoon the remaining stuffing mixture over the mushrooms, pressing it down gently to cover them on all sides. Place the second sheet of pastry over the top and press the edges together to seal (if they don't stick, brush the edges with a little water). Use a knife to trim around the pastry, roughly 1cm/½in away from the filling, removing any excess pastry. Gently score three lines across the top. Use a fork to crimp the edges.

Brush the pastry with olive oil and bake for 40–50 minutes, or until golden brown and cooked through.
